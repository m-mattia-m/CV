In my spare time, I love to do private coding projects. My main interest is developing backends with Go, but I'm also able to develop backends with Kotlin/Java. For my frontends, I mostly use Nuxt (Vue) and Angular. I really like tech, discovering something new and trying out new technologies."

My goal is to write good code, but always keeping the performance aspect in mind. \n\nAs I mentioned before, I want to add Tailscale to my own infrastructure as a zero-trust layer. Sometimes I'm really keen on a topic like security, and then I experiment with this technology. For this reason, I created my own certificates to understand how they work. While I was experimenting with these certificates, I published my public certificate/key on my website so that everyone can download and import them for an encrypted communication with me. Since I understand how certificates work, I have new ideas for how to use them, e.g., mutual authentication for APIs. Even though I'm not an expert in encryption or certificates, I'm interested in this technology. \n\nI worked with Kafka, but I would like to develop my knowlege of this topic because it is very interesting. \n\nFour years ago, in my apprenticeship, I was experimenting with machine learning in my spare time and did all the typical stuff like sorting clothes or animals. I would like to work on this topic in the future because it is a very interesting subject. \n\nRust seems to be a very absorbing programming language, which I want to try. \n\nI also want to try using  search engines like ElasticSearch, Algolia or Typesense.",

        "description": "Before my friends and I developed Bookspread, we started creating Möbilo. We wanted to provide carpenters and joiners with an online tool so that their customers were able to configure their own furniture. After they finished the configuration they could generate a quote. However after talking to several companies, we came to the conclusion that there was not enough interest to make the project worthwhile.",
