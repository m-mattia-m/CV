In my spare time, I love to do some private coding projects. In this curriculum vitae, I'm going to show you a few details about me. My preferred topics are developing backends with Go, but I'm also able to develop backends with Kotlin/Java. For my frontends, I mostly use Nuxt (Vue) and Angular. I really like tech and discovering something new and try out some technologies."

I’m also really fascinated by performance and how I can make my code performant. My goal is to write good code, but I always have the performance aspect in mind. As I mentioned before, I want to add Tailscale to my own infrastructure as a zero-trust layer. Sometimes I'm really keen on a topic like security, and then I’m experimenting with this technology. For this reason, I created my own certificates to understand how this works. While I was playing with these certificates, I published my public certificate/key on my website so that everyone can download and import them to communicate encrypted with me (or send me a mail because I have a S/MIME certificate for my email). Since I understand how certificates work, I have new ideas for how to use them, e.g., mutual authentication for APIs. Even though I'm not an expert in encryption or certificates, I'm interested in technology. I worked with Kafka, but I want more and deeper knowledge on this topic because it is very interesting. 4 Years ago, in my apprenticeship, I was playing with machine learning in my spare time and did all the typical stuff like sorting clothes or animals. I would like to work on this topic in the future because it is a very interesting subject. Rust seems to be a very absorbing programming language, which I want to try. I also want to try using and play with a search engine like ElasticSearch, Algolia or Typesense.",

This was developed for the external development environment as well as the internal environment. The backend was solved with Kotlin and a microservice architecture, and the frontend with Angular. This is solved with a Microservice architecture. If one service has to notify the other services, we are using Kafka to send a message, and all services could subscribe these messages."
